• Maximum likelihood trees are created using the fast algorithm in RAxML using 100 or 200 bootstraps.

• Time-aware trees are made with BEAST using the following parameters:
- Uncorrelated relaxed clock with lognormal distribution, CTMC rate prior
- HKYg substitution model with (1+2),3 codon partitioning
- SkyGrid, 50 parameters, time at last point = 2
- 50,000,000 states
