#### Samples
[insert sample names/stats/metadata table here: ID, collection_date, country, city, Ct, sequencing_date, % coverage, quality (subjective * > ***)]

#### Sequencing
* Library construction was performed using an amplicon-based approach [amplicon-based approach](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PilT4w5jHO-ROsE8TL5WBGa0wSCdTHAsNl1LIOYiTgk).
* Sequencing was performed on the MiSeq.

#### Coding-complete genomes
* Downloaded from NCBI, ViPR, and NextStrain. Only new genomes are added to later folders.
* Consensus sequences sequenced in our lab are added to the root of the 'consensus_sequences' folder.

#### Alignments
* Created using MAFFT.
* Trimmed to just contain the ORFs.

#### Maximum likelihood trees
* Created using the fast algorithm in RAxML using 200 bootstraps.
* Orange = travel-associated cases; Red = local transmissions.
* We root trees on KX447517 from French Polynesia.

#### Time-scaled trees 
* Made with BEAST using the following parameters:
 * Uncorrelated relaxed clock with lognormal distribution, CTMC rate prior.
 * HKY<sub>&#915;</sub> substitution model with (1+2),3 codon partitioning.
 * SkyGrid, 50 parameters, time at last point = 2.
 * 30,000,000 states.
